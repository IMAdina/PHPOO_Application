PHPOO_Application
=================

A PHP object oriented application hosted on heroku server @ http://distributeur.herokuapp.com/

A first serious school project that I've made after 1 year training in programming.
A part the expected functionalities I would like to add sounds and gif animations.
Already started to work on sounds: when you hit the Enter key, an ambiance cold beverage vending machine sound is running.
The volume increases by repeatedly hitting Enter key.
You can stop it anytime by hitting any other key.   

I'll try to upload soon the giff animation and the other sounds...

Enjoy!!!
